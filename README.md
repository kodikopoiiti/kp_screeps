-I want to practice learning some programming logic/structure with screeps

What is Screeps?
Screeps means “scripting creeps.” It’s an open-source sandbox MMO RTS game for programmers, wherein the core mechanic is programming your units’ AI. You control your colony by writing JavaScript which operate 24/7 in the single persistent real-time world filled by other players on par with you. 

Scripting as Gameplay

    Real programming, not just pseudocode. You can use libs from real projects.
    Use JavaScript or compile other languages via WebAssembly.
    Docs and game API of a full-fledged platform.

Programmable Persistent World

    Huge persistent world consisting of 70,000 interconnected game rooms.
    40-server cluster (160 CPU cores) processing player scripts using Node.js.
    Programmable world living a continuous life 24/7 in real-time even when you're offline.

Open Source Sandbox

    Engine released on GitHub as an open and moddable program platform.
    You can change any aspect of game objects' behavior.
    Contribute to the game engine development and earn in-game benefits.

Non-Subscription Shard Launched: 

First, we’re happy to announce that the free non-subscription CPU limit is raised from 10 to 20. Yay!
And now is the most interesting part. Shard3 becomes our first CPU-limited shard. It limits CPU of all players to 20. Even if you have an active subscription and assigned more CPU to this shard, only 20 CPU will be active there. This means this shard is mostly designed for non-subscription players. They can now compete with all their neighbors on equal terms (CPU-wise), whether they are subscribed or not.

In all other aspects, shard3 is a regular shard with Novice and Respawn Areas and portals from shard2 (temporary closed for 60 days). You can freely travel there, but your CPU will be capped, so having a subscription will force you to learn how to optimize your creeps in the same way as non-subscribed players do.

And the last thing: since you get twice as much CPU now when you buy Screeps on Steam, the free 30-day subscription trial is discontinued. We recommend new players to start on shard3 and buy a subscription if they want to expand to other shards.
